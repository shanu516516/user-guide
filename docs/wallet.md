# Twilight Exchange ‚Äì Wallet Guide

This guide explains how to manage user funds via the **Wallet** section of the [Twilight frontend](https://frontend.twilight.rest/wallet). The wallet interface supports fund transfers across **Funding** and **Trading** accounts, enabling users to interact with the Inverse BTC perpetual exchange in a private and composable manner.

## Overview

- **Funding Account**: A standard Cosmos (Twilight Testnet chain) account holding SATS and NYKS tokens. This account is visible on-chain and used for receiving assets (e.g., via faucet).
- **Trading Account (Dark Account)**: A privacy-preserving account containing encrypted balances. These are required to open private perpetual positions.

All operations are executed on the Twilight testnet and can be viewed on the [Twilight Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.twilight.rest/nyks), though the data is encrypted.

## Create Subaccounts

---

*It is recommended to create a separate Subaccount for each trade, as accounts with active positions become locked and cannot be reused until the position is closed. While exchange operations can also be performed using the default "Trading Account," using dedicated Subaccounts provides better flexibility and fund management.*

1. Navigate to the [Homepage](https://frontend.twilight.rest/).
2. Connect your **Keplr** wallet by clicking the wallet icon in the top-right corner of the navigation bar.
3. Once connected, open the *Trading Account* dropdown and select **"Manage Subaccounts"**.  
   ![Manage Subaccounts Menu](/images/wallet/manage-subaccount.png)

4. In the Subaccount Management view, click on **"New"** to create a new Subaccount.

   ![New Subaccount Dialog](/images/wallet/create-new-account-dialog.png)

5. Enter a custom name for your Subaccount and click **"Create"** to finalize the process.  

   ![Enter Subaccount Name](/images/wallet/new-tag-account.png)
