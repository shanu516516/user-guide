# How to Lend for the Twilight Liquidity Pool

The Twilight Pool serves as the central liquidity layer for Twilight‚Äôs inverse perpetual protocol. Traders interact directly with this pool when opening and settling positions, making it the counterparty to all leveraged trades.

The pool earns protocol revenue from:

- **Liquidations** of undercollateralized positions
- **Trading fees**
- A share of the **funding fee** on open positions

By lending BTC into the pool, liquidity providers enhance protocol liquidity while earning a share of the generated revenue.

Twilight enables BTC holders to earn competitive on-chain yield through a secure and privacy-preserving lending mechanism.

> üìå Note: All lending operations are executed privately using encrypted Subaccounts, ensuring financial privacy for institutional participants.
